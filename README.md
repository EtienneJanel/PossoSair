# JÃ¡ posso sair de casa ?
*Can I get out of the house?*

The [Posso Sair](https://possosair.herokuapp.com/) application is a minimalistic Flask web app deployed with Heroku to know in a click if we can get out of the house.

On a weekly basis there is a review of set of rules (depending on region, date, hour of the day...) that are quite easy to misinterpret, so I had the need of an app to help me with that.

By selecting your area and checking the current date time, you'll get a YES/NO answer.

Give it a go at: <https://possosair.herokuapp.com/>
